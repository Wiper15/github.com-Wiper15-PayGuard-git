# PayGuard

An AI agent that automatically mints a "Proof of Debt" NFT on the Solana blockchain when a salary payment is late. Built with Mistral AI, ElevenLabs, and Crossmint to create transparency and leverage for workers.

## The Problem
Millions of workers, especially in the private security sector, face delayed salaries with no recourse or proof.

## The Solution
PayGuard uses a multi-agent workflow to:
1.  Record the debt immutably on the Solana blockchain.
2.  Generate a verifiable "Proof of Debt" NFT via Crossmint.
3.  Create professional follow-up communications using Mistral AI.
4.  Provide audio updates via ElevenLabs for accessibility.
5.  Ensure censorship-resistant operation by using Coral V-1's decentralized AI network as a fallback.
